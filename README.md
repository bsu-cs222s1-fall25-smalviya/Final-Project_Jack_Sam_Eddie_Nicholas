# Weather App - CS222 Final Project

## Project Summary
Weather Service Program Iteration 1: This program uses Command Line Interface (CLI) to get the user's preferences, such as location and hourly vs. daily weather conditions. Then it prints general weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation chance, and dew point to Terminal. It also gives the user the ability to save preferences to get results quicker.
